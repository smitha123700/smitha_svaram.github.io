                    <p>
                        My love for coding and logical thinking has brought me back to the computer industry once again. Being a part of other industries and taking different roles in the recent past, has broadened my horizon of thinking, enabling me to bring out creative and leadership qualities in me. It most certainly has made me to appreciate other professions and roles. </p>
						<p>I have worked as a Senior Systems Engineer and developed and maintained many software systems. I am skilful in web technologies both front end and backend. Most recently I completed an intensive bootcamp in frontend programming with Generation Australia facilitated by Academy Xi, to brush up my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p> 
                        <p>I have enjoyed working in different environments with different cultures and discovered myself as being a very organized, value driven, out of box thinker.</p> 
                    	<p>I want to make a positive impact to the community by using my professional training, strong social conscience and optimism.
